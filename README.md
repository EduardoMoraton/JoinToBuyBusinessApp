# JoinToBuyBusinessApp

This is a brief overview of my Final Year Project (FYP) in WPF. I developed an application that allows users to create and edit products, generate offers, and create PDFs with QR codes for shipping justification.

Features:

Product Management: Add and edit products with details such as name, description, price and photos.
Offer Creation: Create offers that will be shown in the app.
PDF Generation: Create PDF documents with detailed information and unique QR codes for delivery check.
Technologies: WPF, C#, PDF and QR Generation.

Learning: I improved my technical and problem-solving skills and gained experience in developing business applications.
